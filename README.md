This is mostly building over the top of a pre-existing project which can be found by clicking on the foldeer and reading the readme, right now the only modification I have done is training the neural network to detect some more gestures and 
thereby the use of some gestures the arrow up,arrow down,arrow left and arrow right keys can be pressed.
Both palms open - Arrown up
Both palms in rock position- Arrown down
(left hand- A Thumbs-Up pointing left
right hand - Open palm) - Arrown up + Arrown left
(left hand- Open palm
right hand - A Thumbs-Up pointing right) - Arrown up + Arrown right

I will be working to make this into a more sophicated and usable project.
